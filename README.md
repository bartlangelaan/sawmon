## What is this?
This is a work-in-progress tool that can monitor servers and websites. It's very pluggable, fast and useful.

Never. But this is on the roadmap:

- [X] Set up structure with plugins, mongodb etc.
- [X] Find websites based on an Apache virtual hosts folder
- Websites:
    - [X] Check if websites are active, based on their IP adress and the servers'
    - [ ] Check if the websites are online (200 response)
    - [ ] Check what the response time is
    - [ ] Integrate with Google Pagespeed
    - [ ] Allow log-viewing..
- Servers
    - [ ] Check used space, CPU usage etc
    - [ ] Check if online
- [ ] Provide nice UI
- [ ] Make it easy to setup (one-click deploy to Heroku)
- [ ] Allow other developers to add plugins
